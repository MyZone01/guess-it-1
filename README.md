##  DESCRIPTION
This a program that given a number as standard input, prints out a range in which the next number provided should be.

##  ALGORITHME
The value 1.28 is used because it corresponds to the number of standard deviations away from the mean that encompasses 90% of the area under a normal distribution curve. In other words, if the values in the sequence follow a normal distribution, we can reasonably expect that about 90% of the next values will fall within the range defined by the mean plus or minus 1.28 times the standard deviation.

This value comes from a statistical property of normal distributions known as the empirical rule or the 68-95-99.7 rule. The empirical rule states that for any normal distribution, approximately:
+   68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean
+   95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean
+   99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean
Using this rule, we can derive the value 1.28 as the number of standard deviations that encompasses the middle 90% of the data, or equivalently, the number of standard deviations that leaves out the outer 5% on each side of the distribution.

It's worth noting that while the empirical rule is a useful guideline for estimating the spread of data in a normal distribution, it's not exact and can vary depending on the shape of the distribution. In practice, it's often a good idea to visually inspect the data or perform additional statistical tests to confirm that the assumptions of normality and constant variance hold before relying too heavily on these types of calculations.
